# Indeed-Google-Cloud-Storage-Pipeline
A project I've been working on to get more experience with GCP and scraping web data. I am currently stuck on pushing the csv file to Google Cloud Storage.

Update - (5/10/22)
I came across [this solution thread](https://localcoder.org/create-new-csv-file-in-google-cloud-storage-from-cloud-function) that allowed me to fill in some of the missing pieces in my code. From there, I did several debugging cycles of deploying the function and fixing bugs. Much to my delight, I was finally able to get the Google Function to deploy.

One of the most helpful skills I gained through this process was how to read GCP's logs to determine where the errors exist.
