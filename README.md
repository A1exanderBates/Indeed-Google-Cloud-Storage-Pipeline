# Indeed-Google-Cloud-Storage-Pipeline
This is an automated batch pipeline to push data extracted from Web Scraping to Google Cloud Platform. In this project I used Python, BeautifulSoup, and Requests to scrape web data from Indeed and push to Google Cloud Storage. Once your data has been pushed to Cloud Storage, it is a straightforward process to connect a Cloud bucket to a BigQuery table. This step may not be necessary depending on the complexity of your data and whether any data transformations are needed. If you want to see a step-by-step guide, I published an [article](https://medium.com/@alexanderbates.edu/guide-automated-batch-pipeline-with-google-cloud-functions-2a267e3ab6e) on Medium that follows a similar process using a Public API.
